# Overview of export options in http://orgmode.org/manual/Export-settings.html#Export-settings
After a general introduction to the UNIX command line, it is time for
you to analyze your own fastq files. The first important step for any
kind of sequencing data is to get rid of adapter contamination and 
bad quality reads. In this tutorial we will use the programs [[http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/][FastQC]]
and [[http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/][TrimGalore!]] to check the quality of the sequenced libraries before
and after trimming. We will also learn few more UNIX commands that
extract important information from fastq files and that allow you to
turn off your computer while the analysis continues to run on the
remote server.


*IMPORTANT NOTE* Before you get started: to compare characteristics of
your libraries, please keep record of the resulting numbers, like the
number of raw reads, reads after quality control, number of mapped
reads etc. This helps to identify peculiarities/outliers in your
libraries which may either be due to biological peculiarities of your
species or unknown technical issues.


Log on (with =ssh=) to the remote computer with the =-X= option to be
able to use graphical interfaces.

* Overview of sequence lengths
Next Generation Sequencing data is generally stored in fastq
files. Most of the time the data are compressed, either in .zip or in
.gz format.

If your file is zip-compressed, you can use the following command to unzip it:

#+begin_src sh
unzip FILE.fastq.zip
#+end_src

If your file iz gz-compressed, use the following command instead:

#+begin_src sh
gunzip FILE.fastq.gz
#+end_src

*NOTE*: For paired-end sequencing from Illumina, you have two
files. One file with the forward reads (=Sequence_R1.fq=) and one file with
the reverse reads (=Sequence_R2.fq=).


To get a quick impression of the minimum and maximum read lengths in
your fastq file, you can use the following commands (replace
=FILE.fastq= with your own filename):

#+begin_src sh
awk '{if(NR%4==2) print length($0)}' FILE.fastq| sort -n | head -n1
awk '{if(NR%4==2) print length($0)}' FILE.fastq| sort -n | tail -n1
#+end_src

It reads like this: measure the length of every second line in every
group of 4 lines (the sequence line in a fastq file), =sort= it
(numerically with =-n=) and print out either the first (smallest)
value with =head= or the last (biggest) value with =tail=. =NR=
represents the current line number and the =%= sign is the modulus
operator, which divides the line number by 4 (=NR%4=) and returns only
the remainder. This extracts all the sequences, which are on line
2,6,10,14...


The following command allows you to count the sequence lengths:

#+begin_src sh
awk '{if(NR%4==2) print length($0)}' FILE.fastq | sort -n | uniq -c > read_length.txt
#+end_src

The lines that follow makes use of the program R. If you copy and
paste the code into the command line, you will get an overview graphic
of the sequence length distribution 

#+begin_src sh
cat >> Rplot.r << 'EOF'
reads<-read.csv(file="read_length.txt", sep="", header=FALSE)

png(filename = "SequenceLengthDistribution.png",
         width = 480, height = 480, units = "px", pointsize = 12,
          bg = "white")
plot(reads$V2,reads$V1,type="l",xlab="read length",ylab="occurences",col="blue")
dev.off()

EOF


R CMD BATCH Rplot.r
#+end_src

You can open the created figure with the GNOME image viewer using the
following command:

#+begin_src sh
eog SequenceLengthDistribution.png
#+end_src


#+CAPTION: Example graphic of the length distribution in a fastq file
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 10cm :float figure
[[file:SequenceLengthDistribution.png]]

Does the sequence length-distribution meet your expectations? 

*NOTE*: While the Ion Torrent sequences will differ in length (as in
Figure 1), the Illumina sequences will all have the same read length
(301 bp). 


* Quality control
To inspect the quality of the sequencing data, we use
[[http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/][FastQC]]. In
the installation and setup instructions of the program
([[http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/INSTALL.txt][link]]),
you will find that FastQC can run in an interactive mode or in a
command line mode. This tutorial uses the command-line version.

FastQC knows a number of standard adapter sequences used for HTS,
including adapters used on Illumina platforms; To get an overview of
the contaminants (overrepresented sequences) that FastQC will by
default look for, type

#+begin_src sh
less /usr/share/fastqc/Contaminants/contaminant_list.txt
#+end_src

However, FastQC is not
aware of the sequences used by the IonTorrent platform. To inform
FastQC of the adapter sequences we have used we call FastQc with the
=--contaminants= option to specify a file containing the
adapter sequences we have used.

So, to run FastQC on your file, simply type (where adapters.txt is a file
containing the adapter sequences in a name[tab]sequence list):

#+begin_src sh
fastqc --contaminants adapters.txt FILE.fastq
#+end_src

The output will be saved in a folder that has the name of your fastq
file and ends with fastqc, like =FILE_fastqc=. Use the =cd= command to
move into the folder and open the produced =fastqc_report.html= either
with =firefox= or =chromium-browser= (one of the two should work). 

#+begin_src sh
firefox fastqc_report.html
chromium-browser fastqc_report.html
#+end_src

Get familiar with the output. You can find guidance on how to 
interpret the output of each module [[http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/][here]].

# Tor Erik informed me that they will use the IonPGM HiQ Ion Sphere
# protocol, which targets a library size of 400bp + adapters.

* Trimming low quality reads and adapters

# XX Martin checks if fastqc can be run with awareness of Ion Torrent
# adapters (not only Illumina adapters) and how to read the fastqc input
# into R.  (See above modification of how to run FastQC)

[[http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/][TrimGalore!]] is a wrapper script to automate quality and adapter
trimming as well as quality control ([[http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/trim_galore_User_Guide_v0.3.7.pdf][User Guide]]).

When the program is installed, it can be used with 

#+begin_src sh
trim_galore [options] <filename(s)>
#+end_src

You can get an overview of the options with the =--help= option:

#+begin_src sh
trim_galore --help
#+end_src

With the default settings, TrimGalore! trims low-quality ends with a
Phred quality score threshold of 20 (can be changed with =-q=) and
discards reads that become shorter than 20 bp (can be changed with
=--length=).

TrimGalore! uses the program [[https://code.google.com/p/cutadapt/][Cutadapt]] to find and remove adapters from
the 3' end of the reads (see Fig. [[fig:adapters]]). The program Cutadapt
itself gives you more options for adapter trimming and allows you to
remove adapters from the 5'-end of the sequence (see
http://cutadapt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide.html)

** Trimmiing Ion-Torrent adapters

The Ion-P1- and Ion-A-adapters are supposed to be automatically
trimmed off on the Ion Server. So, the fastq files with the raw reads
should not contain these adapters anymore. Still, it is good to check
if there are any adapters left in your library - they can have
negative effects on further analyses.



The adapters used for Ion Torrent sequencing are shown in
Fig. [[fig:ionadapters]] and their orientation in the libraries is shown
in Fig. [[fig:adapterorientations]].

#+name: fig:ionadapters
#+CAPTION: Non-barcoded Ion-A and -P1 adapter sequences. In each sequence, a "*" indicates a phosphorothioate bond, for protection from nucleases and to preserve the directionality of adapter ligation

#+name: fig:adapterorientations
#+CAPTION: Ion adapters in the amplified library. BC is an optional barcode sequence.
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 14cm :float figure
[[file:IonLibraryWithAdapters.png]].

To trim off the A-adapter, use TrimGalore! with the command:

#+begin_src sh
trim_galore \
-a CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG \
--stringency 3 \
FILE.fastq
#+end_src


The =\= sign just means that the command continues on the next
line. You could type the entire command on a single line.


The option =--stringency 3= means that a >3bp overlap with the adapter
sequence will be trimmed off the 3' end. The program writes a file
that ends with =trimming_report.txt=, which reports the number of
reads that have been trimmed and/or removed.

# XX I can't find information on what the 'expected' is based on in this report fiel 
The output file has the ending =trimmed.fq=. Use this file as
input to TrimGalore! to trim off the P1-adapter:

#+begin_src sh
trim_galore \
-a CCACTACGCCTCCGCTTTCCTCTCTATGGGCAGTCGGTGAT \
--stringency 3 \
--fastqc FILE_trimmed.fq
#+end_src

The =--fastqc= option will automatically run FastQC in the default
mode. Compare the FastQC outputs before and after trimming.

** Trimming Illumina adapters
Depending on the settings for Illumina sequencing, the adapters can
be, but don't have to be, automatically removed from the fastq files
when you get them from the sequencing machine.

The Illumina adapters are as follows:

#+begin_src sh
TruSeq Universal Adapter:
5' AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT 3'

TruSeq Indexed Adapter
5' P*GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCACNNNNNNATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG 3'
#+end_src

Here, =NNNNNN= represents a barcode of six nucleotides in the indexed adapter.

TrimGalore! can be run with the option =--illumina=. This trims the
first 13bp of the Illumina universal adapter =AGATCGGAAGAGC=. This
option removes illumina adapters from most standard libraries,
including TruSeq adapters.


TrimGalore! also performs trimming of paired-end libraries, as the
Illumina libraries that were prepared in this course. This allows to
discard too short read pairs without disturbing the sequence order of
FastQ files, which is required by many a ligners.  With the option
=--paired= TrimGalore! expects two paired fastq input files, like
=file1_1.fq= and =file1_2.fq=.  Here, both sequences of a sequence
pair must have a certain minimum length (specified by the =--length=
option in order to be kept. If only one of the two paired end reads
became too short, tThe option =--retain_unpaired= can be applied to
write the unpaired read that is long enough to eithe =unpaired_1.fq=
or =unpaired_2.fq= The length cutoff for unpaired si ngle end reads is
governed by the parameters =--length_1= and =--length_2=

To trim our illumina paired-end libraries we can use:

#+begin_src sh
trim_galore \
--illumina \
--stringency 3 \
--paired \
--retain_unpaired \
--length_1 20 \
--length_2 20 \
--fastqc \
Illumina_R1.fastq \
Illumina_R2.fastq 
#+end_src

* COMMENT Fraction of duplicate reads

Duplicate reads (identical reads present more than once in the
library) can skew genotype estimates and thus should be identified and
removed before SNP calling. Duplicates can result from primer or PCR
bias towards these reads and poor libraries can have levels of
duplicates >50%.

At this step, we will calculate the fraction of duplicates but we will
remove them only after /de novo/ genome assembly and read mapping.
The approach is based on the [[http://sfg.stanford.edu/SFG.pdf][Simple fool's guide to population
genomics via RNAseq]] and makes use of =fastx_collapser= from the
[[http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/][FASTX-Toolkit]] and a python script (=fastqduplicatecounter.py=).

First, use =fastx_collapser= to combine and count all identical reads.

#+begin_src sh
fastx_collapser -Q 33 -v -i INPUTFILE.fq -o OUTPUTFILE.txt
#+end_src

The =INPUTFILE= is your trimmed fastq file. =-Q 33= specifies that
quality scores are Phred33 encoded.  The =OUTPUTFILE= is used in the
next step with the python script 'fastqduplicatecounter.py'.

#+begin_src sh
fastqduplicatecounter.py OUTPUTFILE.txt OUTPUTFILE_header.txt > OUTPUTFILE_duplicatecount.txt
#+end_src

This script calculates the fractions of duplicate and singleton
reads. Open the outputfile with =less OUTPUTFILE_duplicatecount.txt=
and check the percentage of duplicate reads.
